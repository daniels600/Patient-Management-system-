# How to run PHPUnit Test
- The controller folder has in it all the various classes with their respective functions/methods
- In that folder you will find the test classes which were used to test for the class's methods
- In running the tests you have to uncomment the data in the individual functions you want to test for and run you test
- Also you can create or edit the data in the original class with the function with your own data to test if the functions work or not.
- This is because some functions work by the passing of parameters into them.
